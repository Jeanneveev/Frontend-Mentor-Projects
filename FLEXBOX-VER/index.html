<!-- 1. Look at the design -->
<!-- Plan ahead of time what you need to do and how you'll do it. -->
	<!-- for instance, here, the cards are split into 3 columns,
		 but how are the cards ordered within those columns? Does Karma
		 come first or does Calculator?
	-->
<!-- Looking at the mobile view can help alliviate questions or give further insight. -->
	<!-- it shows that Karma comes before Calculator -->
		<!-- this makes an actual grid harder as you'd have to forcibly order
			 Karma and Calculator, a fact that's better to know earlier than later
		-->
		<!-- Instead we can use 3 adjacent flexboxes -->

<!-- 2. Make the HTML for the overall layout -->
<!-- Make sure to use scemantic HTML and descriptive class and id names -->

<!-- 3. Make the HTML for the smaller layout -->
<!-- Look at the boxes you split things into in step 1 and split those into smaller boxes -->
	<!-- Here, that means taking a single card and breaking down it's layout -->
<!-- 4. Add the colors and fonts given in the design -->
<!-- 5. Set the block-level widths based on the design -->
<!-- 6/7. Either:
		Focus making one modular piece then fitting it in the rest of the layout
			OR
		Focus on making the layout, then make a modular piece to fit in it
-->

<!-- TIPS -->
<!-- Emmet Abbrev -->
	<!-- Use *x to make x number of things -->
		<!-- .col*3 makes 3 divs of class "col" -->

<!-- VSCode Specific -->
	<!-- Use ALT+Click to make a secondary cursor -->
		<!-- This is good for repeated actions, like putting the card div in the col div -->
	<!-- Select a tag and us CTRL+D to make a new cursor at the next appearance of that tag-->

<!-- General Rules -->
<!-- Don't skip heading sizes -->
<!-- For an img, the alt attribute should always be included, but if it's just there for decaration purposes, the attribute can be left empty -->
